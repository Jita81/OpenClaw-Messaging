# Governance

OpenClaw Messaging is an open-source project. This document describes how the project is governed.

## Model

The project uses a **benevolent dictator** model for now:

- One or two **maintainers** review and merge pull requests.
- Decisions are made by **consensus** where possible; maintainers have final say on disputes.
- Anyone can open issues or submit pull requests. Maintainers aim to respond within **one week**.
- For **major changes** (new features, breaking API changes), open an issue for discussion before submitting a PR.

## Contribution

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for how to contribute (code style, tests, documentation, commits).

## Seed peers

The project may run a small number of **seed peers** (same code as any community peer) to give agents a guaranteed starting point. Seed peers are provided as a convenience, not a guarantee. Community members are encouraged to run their own peers. Seed peer URLs are documented in the README and on the website.
